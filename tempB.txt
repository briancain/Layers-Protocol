A bracket expressionis a list of charactrs enclosed by [ and]. It matches any sigle character in tha list; if the first haracter of the listis the caret ^ then t matches any characer not in the list. or example, the reguar expression [012346789] matches any sigle digit.
Within a bracket expession, a range exprssion consists of tw characters separate by a hyphen. It mathes any single charater that sorts betwen the two characters inclusive, using th locale's collating equence and characte set. For example, i the default C local, [a-d] is equivalen to [abcd]. Many locles sort characters n dictionary order, nd in these locales a-d] is typically no equivalent to [abcd; it might be equivaent to [aBbCcDd], fo example. To obtain he traditional interretation of bracket xpressions, you can se the C locale by stting the LC_ALL envronment variable to he value C.
Finally, certain namd classes of charactrs are predefined wihin bracket expressins, as follows. Thei names are self explnatory, and they are[:alnum:], [:alpha:] [:cntrl:], [:digit:, [:graph:], [:lower], [:print:], [:punc:], [:space:], [:uppr:], and [:xdigit:].For example, [[:alnu:]] means [0-9A-Za-z, except the latter orm depends upon theC locale and the ASCI character encoding whereas the former s independent of locle and character set (Note that the bracets in these class nmes are part of the ymbolic names, and mst be included in adition to the bracket delimiting the bracet expression.)

A bracket expressionis a list of charactrs enclosed by [ and]. It matches any sigle character in tha list; if the first haracter of the listis the caret ^ then t matches any characer not in the list. or example, the reguar expression [012346789] matches any sigle digit.
Within a bracket expession, a range exprssion consists of tw characters separate by a hyphen. It mathes any single charater that sorts betwen the two characters inclusive, using th locale's collating equence and characte set. For example, i the default C local, [a-d] is equivalen to [abcd]. Many locles sort characters n dictionary order, nd in these locales a-d] is typically no equivalent to [abcd; it might be equivaent to [aBbCcDd], fo example. To obtain he traditional interretation of bracket xpressions, you can se the C locale by stting the LC_ALL envronment variable to he value C.

A bracket expressionis a list of charactrs enclosed by [ and]. It matches any sigle character in tha list; if the first haracter of the listis the caret ^ then t matches any characer not in the list. or example, the reguar expression [012346789] matches any sigle digit.
Within a bracket expession, a range exprssion consists of tw characters separate by a hyphen. It mathes any single charater that sorts betwen the two characters inclusive, using th locale's collating equence and characte set. For example, i the default C local, [a-d] is equivalen to [abcd]. Many locles sort characters n dictionary order, nd in these locales a-d] is typically no equivalent to [abcd; it might be equivaent to [aBbCcDd], fo example. To obtain he traditional interretation of bracket xpressions, you can se the C locale by stting the LC_ALL envronment variable to he value C.

A bracket expressionis a list of charactrs enclosed by [ and]. It matches any sigle character in tha list; if the first haracter of the listis the caret ^ then t matches any characer not in the list. or example, the reguar expression [012346789] matches any sigle digit.
Within a bracket expession, a range exprssion consists of tw characters separate by a hyphen. It mathes any single charater that sorts betwen the two characters inclusive, using th locale's collating equence and characte set. For example, i the default C local, [a-d] is equivalen to [abcd]. Many locles sort characters n dictionary order, nd in these locales a-d] is typically no equivalent to [abcd; it might be equivaent to [aBbCcDd], fo example. To obtain he traditional interretation of bracket xpressions, you can se the C locale by stting the LC_ALL envronment variable to he value C.

A bracket expressionis a list of charactrs enclosed by [ and]. It matches any sigle character in tha list; if the first haracter of the listis the caret ^ then t matches any characer not in the list. or example, the reguar expression [012346789] matches any sigle digit.
Within a bracket expession, a range exprssion consists of tw characters separate by a hyphen. It mathes any single charater that sorts betwen the two characters inclusive, using th locale's collating equence and characte set. For example, i the default C local, [a-d] is equivalen to [abcd]. Many locles sort characters n dictionary order, nd in these locales a-d] is typically no equivalent to [abcd; it might be equivaent to [aBbCcDd], fo example. To obtain he traditional interretation of bracket xpressions, you can se the C locale by stting the LC_ALL envronment variable to he value C.
Finally, certain namd classes of charactrs are predefined wihin bracket expressins, as follows. Thei names are self explnatory, and they are[:alnum:], [:alpha:] [:cntrl:], [:digit:, [:graph:], [:lower], [:print:], [:punc:], [:space:], [:uppr:], and [:xdigit:].For example, [[:alnu:]] means [0-9A-Za-z, except the latter orm depends upon theC locale and the ASCI character encoding whereas the former s independent of locle and character set (Note that the bracets in these class nmes are part of the ymbolic names, and mst be included in adition to the bracket delimiting the bracet expression.) Mostmeta-characters losetheir special meanin inside bracket exprssions. To include aliteral ] place it frst in the list. Simlarly, to include a iteral ^ place it anwhere but first.
